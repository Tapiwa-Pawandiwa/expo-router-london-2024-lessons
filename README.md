# React Native London Conf 2024 Workshop: Expo Router
Workshop exercises for the Expo Router workshop at React Native London Conf 2024.

## How to use this repo

1. Fork the [companion repo](https://github.com/keith-kurak/expo-router-london-2024-starter). You'll start working right on `main`.
2. Start at the first module by opening up the file starting with "01-".
3. Do the rest of the modules in order.

## Prerequisites
- Node LTS version (18+)
- Visual Studio Code
- Expo Go on your device or simulator
- Web browser

You actually don't need a Mac for this workshop. You don't need to do any native builds for the main workshop exercises (maybe useful for 1 or 2 side quests)

## Test your setup before the workshop

Do these steps to ensure you'll be ready to go when the workshop starts:

1. Fork and clone the [template repo](https://github.com/keith-kurak/expo-router-london-2024-starter).

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code and install the recommended extensions.

3. Restore dependencies with

```npm install```

4. Run `npx expo start`

5. Press `w` to open the app in your web browser.

6. Scan the QR code with your phone to test the app in Expo Go.

> [!TIP]
> Pull changes from the forked starter repo and run `npm install` again right before the workshop, as there may be fixes and version bumps!
